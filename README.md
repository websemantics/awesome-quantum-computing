> A curated list of Quantum Computing resources, articles, programming languages and projects. The main idea is that everyone can contribute here, so we can have a central repository of informations about this mind-boggling subject that we all can keep up-to-date.

Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list thing.


## What is Quantum Computing

Human evelution depends on developing an alternative model of computation to classic computers.

1- Machine Learning
2- Genetic Engineering
3- Artificial Intelligence

Physical resources used to build Quantium Computers,  

- Entanglement
- Quantium Tunneling
- Superposition
